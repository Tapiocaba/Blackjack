<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

* Home:
  * this is a placeholder

  Our home page utilzes CSS animations and transform to have the card animations in place of a traditional navigaton bar.


* Learn:

  Our learn has three sections: the rules, basic strategies, and more advanced strategies, such as card counting. On the side, we implemented a sticky navbar that will direct you to the header of different article sections, and the top navigation bar has CSS animation when switching between the words.

* Play Blackjack:

* Blackjack Solver

  Right now, our Blackjack solver is extremely simple since our other option was to implement the entire odds board. In future iterations, we hope to include those, but for now, it will simply check whether it's (cont. later)



## Future Improvements

This project was mostly a front-end project that we wanted to tackle, and we were able to implement most of the stylistic features. However, there are still some improvements that can be made in future iterations:

* Adding split options into the solver.
* More detailed learn pages with quiz prompts to ask for information
* Inclusion of money and betting in the 'play' section.
* Different play level difficulties.
* Adding page tranistions and other front-end features to make the website more seamless.
