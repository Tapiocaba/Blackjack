<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
For our CS50 Final Project, we built all-in-one website to teach a player Blackjack. This includes descriptions of basic and advanced strategies, a Blackjack simulator, and a best move calculator.  

Demonstration: [https://youtube.com](https://example.com)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and open file
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Tapiocaba/Blackjack.git
   ```
2. Utilize your IDE to open the website. On VSCode, we downloaded the 'open in browser' extention, but you can also do the following:
   ```sh
    cd C:Users\(insert your path here)\Blackjack
    start index.html
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Find a detailed description of our design and functions at [DESIGN.md](https://github.com/Tapiocaba/Blackjack/blob/main/DESIGN.md).

Our project has multiple navigation bars in order to click through the different pages. At any point, click the "Blackjack50" logo in the top left corner to return to index.html. On **index.html**, clicking on the animated cards will bring you to the different pages. After clicking to the **learn** pages (basics.html, advanced.html, rules.html), it will take you to **rules.html.** The navigation bar on the top right corner will take you to the other pages. On both **solver.html** and **play.html,** clicking Blackjack50 will take you back to the home page.

If there are any questions regarding usage of the software, feel free to contact us or submit a bug issue report.

## Future Improvements

This project was mostly a front-end project that we wanted to tackle, and we were able to implement most of the stylistic features. However, there are still some improvements that can be made in future iterations:

* Adding split options into the solver.
* Adding automatic win for instant blackjack.
* Adding a new game button to restart the game.
* More detailed learn pages with quiz prompts to ask for information.
* Inclusion of money and betting in the 'play' section.
* Different play level difficulties.
* Adding page tranistions and other front-end features to make the website more seamless.
