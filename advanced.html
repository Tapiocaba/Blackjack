            <h1> Basics of Blackjack</h1>

            <section id="intro">
                <p class="learnPara">
                    Counting cards is a strategy a player can use to determine whether
                    the player or the dealer has an advantage on the next hand. This
                    gives card counters a way to overcome the house edge and win more consistently at Blackjack.
                
                    The four steps of counting cards:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Assign a value of each card</li>
                        <li>Keep a “running count” based on the values of the dealt card</li>
                        <li>Use this information to calculate the “true count,” or the
                            count per deck</li>
                        <li>Adjust bets as the true count rises</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="temp1">
                <h2 class="learnHeading">Step 1:Assign a Value to Each Card</h2>
                <p class="learnPara">
                    The most common card counting system is Hi-Lo, in which the card values are as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>2 - 6 = +1</li>
                        <li>7 - 9 = 0</li>
                        <li>10 - Ace = -1</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="temp2">
                <h2 class="learnHeading">Step 2: Keep a “Running Count”</h2>
                <p class="learnPara">
                    Based on the card dealt, add the assigned value to the current running count
                    of the round. As the running count increases, the advantage shifts to the player.
                    Conversely, as the running count decreases, the advantage shifts to the house.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="temp3">
                <h2 class="learnHeading">Keep a “True Count”</h2>
                <p class="learnPara">
                    Keeping a true count, in addition to a running count allows the player to continue
                    beating the house edge even when playing with multiple decks.
                </p>
                <p class="learnPara">
                    The reason true count is important is because it keeps track of not only the number
                    of extra high cards, but the concentration of high cards compared to the concentration
                    of low cards. Even with the same running count, this concentration will vary based
                    on how many decks are remaining in the game.
                </p>
                <p class="learnPara">
                    The calculation for true count is the (running count) / (decks remaining).
                </p>
                <p class="learnPara">
                    Example: If the running count is 8, and there are 4 decks remaining, the true count is 2.
                <p class="learnPara">
                    Example: if the running count is -5 and there are 2 decks remaining, the true count is -2.
                </p>

            <section id="temp4">
                <h2 class="learnHeading">Step 4: Change Your Bets Based on True Count</h2>
                <p class="learnPara">
                    To put this information to use, the player should adjust their bets according to
                    the true count. Specifically they should raise their bets as the true count rises
                    since this is when the player has the advantage. In turn, they should lower
                    their bets when the true count is negative or neutral and the house has the advantage
