                <p class="learnPara">
                    Blackjack is a game of chance and probabilities -- there's no strategy that will guarentee you victory, but there
                    are ways to give yourself the best possible chance of winning based on your hand. In order to adopt these strategies,
                    you'll have to memorize and retain as much information as you can while playing as many games of Blackjack as possible.
                    Eventually, it will become almost natural!

                    As said in basic strategy and the rules, there are multiple options for what you can do. Different games will have different rules,
                    but generally you will have the option to either hit, stand, or double down. In some games, you can also surrender. Depending on whether you
                    have a hard or soft hand, you'll take different actions. Below, the strategy charts are basedo on the dealerhitting a soft hand 17.

                    since this is when the player has the advantage. In turn, they should lower
                    their bets when the true count is negative or neutral and the house has the advantage

                <p class="learnPara">
                    Counting cards is a strategy a player can use to determine whether
                    the player or the dealer has an advantage on the next hand. This
                    gives card counters a way to overcome the house edge and win more consistently at Blackjack.
                </p>
                <p class="learnPara">
                    The hi-lo counting system that we'll be discussing was introduced in 1963 by Harvey Dubner, an electrical engineer and mathmatician. By using his
                    strategy in combination with memorization of the basic strategy above, it can greatly increase your change of
                    winning!
                </p>
                <p class="learnPara">
                    However, be careful when you card count. Although it's not illegal, many casinos will immedietly eject you if you're
                    caught card counting, and you won't be able to redeem your chips / money from the cashier.

                <ul class="bullets">
                    <li class="bullets-list">Assign a value of each card</li>

                        <li class="bullets-list">2 - 6 = +1</li>

                <p class="learnPara">
                    Based on the card dealt, add the assigned value to the current running count
                    of the round. As the running count increases, the advantage shifts to the player.
                    Conversely, as the running count decreases, the advantage shifts to the house.

                <h2 class="learnHeading">Step 3: Keep a “True Count”</h2>
                <p class="learnPara">
                    Keeping a true count, in addition to a running count allows the player to continue
                    beating the house edge even when playing with multiple decks.
                </p>
                <p class="learnPara">
                    True count is important  because it keeps track of not only the number
                    of extra high cards, but the concentration of high cards compared to the concentration
                    of low cards. Even with the same running count, this concentration will vary based
                    on how many decks are remaining in the game.

                <p class="learnPara">
                    The calculation for true count is the (running count) / (decks remaining).
                </p>
                <p class="learnPara">
                    <b>Example:</b> If the running count is 8, and there are 4 decks remaining, the true count is 2.
