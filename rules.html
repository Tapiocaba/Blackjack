                    Although basic strategy is not enough to overcome the house edge and guarantee

                    The game is played with a standard 52-card pack. The dealer deals one card face
                    up to each player, then one face up themselves. They then deal another round
                    face up, but keep their card face down. In the end, each player will have two
                    face-up cards, and the dealer will have one face-up card and one face-down.
